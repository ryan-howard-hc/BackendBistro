Assuming that the gameplay is already in place to run, design a class representing a single piece in a game of tetris
as well as any other classes you might need to play a game of tetris

Given: tetramino - specific shape that can rotate around - J , L, backwards L , Z , backwards Z, square, 

Looking for class structure/design patterns
Data Structures

Stretch: Code for the actions


AS a user, see a shape that I can move

class shape
    create variables for a simple shape
    create functions for each shaped that is produced
    create a nested function for rotation of each shape within each shape function

    variables for each orientation
    upright = 0
    left = 270
    right = 90
    down = 180

    userleft = -90
    userright = +90

        while j is upright 
            if user presses userright, would add 90 to reorient object to a different set position dictated by an object made prior

if 0, return to 270, rather than negative

Want to create a classname for each individual block
Want to be able to define how it can rotate and orient according to both the board as well as orient to the other blocks placed on the board - stretch

Want to be able to make the class/shape be able to rotate for the player
I would like to be able to define my shapes using a grid, and 'blacking out' any piece of said grid to make it transparent/void in the context of the board/other pieces

Example like having a square as the first block |               for an L block
                                                | 
                                                | | 
                                        
                                                | |
                                                | |             for a square block



The best course of action would to be able to create probably an if else to define the orientation and rotation for each direction
    if else being if it is upright, I would want to be able to rotate it left 90 degrees and right 90 degrees
    else if it is rotated left 90 degrees for example, i would want to be able to have it recognize this, and be able to rotate it in a similar fashion but to upright orientation or upside down



    probabyl would want to add a break towards the end for when the piece hits the another block or the bottom of the playscreen
    and/ Or a boolean to define whether it stops true or false while it is in progress

    



class for each shape/object
class for the board and grid
class for how each line is defined with each square of the grids used
